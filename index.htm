    <h2>We're having a picnic on Friday Sept 15th @ Mercer County Park in Hamilton, NJ !!</h2>
    <p>
        It's been more than a few years since our last picnic and it's time! We'll form a small team soon to help plan food, activities, etc. 
        Reach out to Vinnie if you'd like to help.
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, <b>please RSVP below!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Where and when?</b><br> Friday Sept. 15th from 12pm-5pm at Mercer County Park West Picnic Area
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What does it cost?</b><br> The hope is to cover all costs with sponsors. We may ask for a small contribution, TBD.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Why Mercer County Park and not the old place?</b><br> Music. We're looking to host the Lonesome Pines, a stellar Americana style roots band from NJ. 
        You may recognize one of the members. Amplified music is not permitted at Thompson Park. Also, Mercer County Park is arguably the best park in NJ, 
        centrally located, and very close to public transportation. Check it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Located alongside Lake Mercer and within walking distance of the Marina, is the Mercer Park West Picnic Area. 
        The area includes a 30-foot by 60-foot pavilion and is equipped with 1 large and 1 small charcoal cooking grill, electricity, 
        and running water, 14 picnic tables under the pavilion and scattered throughout picnic area, and benches overlooking Lake Mercer.  
        Paddleboats are available for rent at the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Can non-APers attend?</b><br>  Yes, since this is not a sanctioned AP event, friends and family are welcome.  Staffers will need to take PTO to attend.
